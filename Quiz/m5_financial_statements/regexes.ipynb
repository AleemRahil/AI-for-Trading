    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following lessons we will learn how to create basic **Regular Expressions** in Python. Regular Expressions, also known as Regexes, are used to find different patterns of text. In general, regexes work by first specifying the rules for the set of possible patterns that you want to find and then making queries such as \"Is this pattern found at the beginning of this string?\" or “Is there a match for this pattern anywhere in this string?”. We will learn for example, how to write regular expressions to find phone numbers, names, and email addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end this lesson you should be able to read and write basic regular expressions in Python and know how to apply them to get useful financial information from 10-Ks."

Therefore, by using raw strings, we avoid the problem of Python interpreting the special characters in regexes in the wrong way."

    "# Finding Words Using Regexes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to find letters and words in a string using regular expressions. Throughout these lessons, we will use the `re` module from Python's standard library to work with regular expressions. The `re` module not only contains functions that allow us to check if a given regular expression matches a particular string, but also contains functions that allow us to modify strings in various ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by using a regular expression to find all the locations of a single letter in a given string. To do this, we will use the `re.compile()` function from the `re` module. The `re.compile(pattern)` function converts a regular expression `pattern` into a regular expression object. This allows us to save our regular expressions into objects that can be used later to perform pattern matching using various methods, such as `.match()`, `.search()`, `.findall()`, and `.finditer()`. Let’s see how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will find all the locations of the letter `a` in a string named `sample_text`. In this case, our regular expression pattern will just be `'a'` and we will pass it to the `re.compile()` function as a raw string. We will save the regular expression object returned by the `re.compile()` function in a variable called `regex`. We will then use the `.finditer()` method to search our `sample_text` for the given regular expression contained in the `regex` object. The `.finditer()` method returns an iterator with all the non-overlapping matches of our regular expression pattern in the string. We should also mention that the `.finditer()` method scans the strings from left-to-right, and returns the matches in the order found. Since the `.finditer()` method returns an iterator, we can loop through it to print all the matches, as shown below:"

However, the backslash can also be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. Here is a list of the special sequences we are going to look at in this notebook:\n",

Therefore, if we want to find all the names of the mountains we need to indicate in our regular expression that the period (`.`) in the abbreviation is optional. We can do this by using the `?` metacharacter in our regular expression. The `?` will match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For example, the regular expression `ab?` will match either `a` or `ab`. In other words, the `?` after the `b` indicates that the `b` after the `a` is optional. Let’s see how this works.\n",

Since all names have a first name then we can use this group `([a-zA-z]+)` to match all the first names. Now, not all names have middle names, so having a middle name is optional. Since the first and middle name are separated by a whitespace we also need to indicate that the whitespace is also optional. So, to do indicate that the whitespace and middle name are optional we will include the `?` metacharacter after the whitespace and second group, `[ ]?([a-zA-z]+)?`. After the first or middle name we have a whitespace that we can match with `\\[  \\]`. Notice that in this case we didn't use the sequence `\\\\s` since this will match newlines as well and we don't what match those. Finally we make a third group to match the last name. Since all names have last names, we don't need to use the `?` metacharacter. Putting all together we get:"

    "We saw at the beginning of this lesson that regexes are case sensitive, therefore we often have to use regexes with both uppercase and lower case letters. However, the `re.compile(pattern, flags)` function, has a `flag` keyword that can be used to allow more flexibility. For example, the `re.IGNORECASE` flag can be used to perform **case-insensitive** matching. In the code below we have a string that contains the name Walter written in two different combinations of upper and lower case letters. In order to be able to find this two renditions of Walter, we will probably have to use a long character set to be able to account for all possible combinations of lower and upper case letters. However, in this case we can use the `re.IGNORECASE` to indicate that we don't care about the case of the letters, we just want to find the name Walter no matter how it is written. Let's see how this works:"
