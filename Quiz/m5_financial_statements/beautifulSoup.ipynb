    "# Parsing an HTML File\n",

    "To parse an HTML or XML document, we need to pass the document into the BeautifulSoup constructor. The BeautifulSoup constructor, `BeautifulSoup(file, 'parser')`, parses the given `file` using the given `parser` and returns a BeautifulSoup object. We can pass our `file` to the constructor either as a string or as an open filehandle, while the `parser` is a string that indicates the parser we want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BeautifulSoup constructor will transform the HTML or XML file into a complex tree of Python objects. One of this objects is the BeautifulSoup object returned by the constructor. The BeautifulSoup object itself represents the document as a whole and can be searched using various methods, as we will see in the following lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we start by importing the BeautifulSoup library by using the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then open the `sample.html` file and pass the open filehandle `f` to the `BeautifulSoup` constructor. We also set the `parser` in the constructor to `lxml` to indicate that we want to use lxmlâ€™s HTML parser. The `BeautifulSoup` constructor will return a BeautifulSoup object that we will save in the `page_content` variable. We then print the BeautifulSoup object to see what it looks like."
